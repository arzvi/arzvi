- 👋 Hi, I’m Arun Srinivasan
- 👀 I’m interested in making data work it's worth. Python, AWS data services, warehouses, pub-sub services are somethings I'm constantly working on. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kafka and connecting it with distributed databases like cassandra and yugabyte. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on kafka coding.
